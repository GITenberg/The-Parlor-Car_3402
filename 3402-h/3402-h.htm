<p>Transcribed from &ldquo;The Sleeping Car and Other
Farces&rdquo; 1911 Houghton Mifflin Company edition by David
Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org</p>
<h1><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>THE
PARLOR-CAR.<br />
Farce.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: A Parlor-Car on the New York
Central Railroad.&nbsp; It is late afternoon in the early autumn,
with a cloudy sunset threatening rain.&nbsp; The car is
unoccupied save by a gentleman, who sits fronting one of the
windows, with his feet in another chair; a newspaper lies across
his lap; his hat is drawn down over his eyes, and he is
apparently asleep.&nbsp; The rear door of the car opens, and the
conductor enters with a young lady, heavily veiled, the porter
coming after with her wraps and travelling-bags.&nbsp; The
lady&rsquo;s air is of mingled anxiety and desperation, with a
certain fierceness of movement.&nbsp; She casts a careless glance
over the empty chairs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Conductor</i>: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your ticket,
madam.&nbsp; You can have any of the places you like here,
or,&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at the unconscious gentleman, and then
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>at the
young lady,&mdash;&ldquo;if you prefer, you can go and take that
seat in the forward car.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lucy Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t ride
backwards.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay here, please.&nbsp; Thank
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The porter places her things in a chair by a
window, across the car from the sleeping gentleman, and she
throws herself wearily into the next seat, wheels round in it,
and lifting her veil gazes absently out at the landscape.&nbsp;
Her face, which is very pretty, with a low forehead shadowed by
thick blond hair, shows the traces of tears.&nbsp; She makes
search in her pocket for her handkerchief, which she presses to
her eyes.&nbsp; The conductor, lingering a moment, goes out.</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right here, at de end of
de cah, if you should happen to want anything,
miss,&rdquo;&mdash;making a feint of arranging the shawls and
satchels.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you like some dese things hung
up?&nbsp; Well, dey&rsquo;ll be jus&rsquo; as well in de
chair.&nbsp; We&rsquo;s pretty late dis afternoon; more&rsquo;n
four hours behin&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Ought to been into Albany
&lsquo;fore dis.&nbsp; Freight train off de track jus&rsquo; dis
side o&rsquo; Rochester, an&rsquo; had to wait.&nbsp; Was you
going to stop at Schenectady, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, absently: &ldquo;At
Schenectady?&rdquo;&nbsp; After a pause, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s de next
station, and den de cahs don&rsquo;t stop ag&rsquo;in till dey
git to Albany.&nbsp; Anything else I can do for you now,
miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;No, no, thank you,
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Porter</i> hesitates, takes off his
cap, and scratches his head with a murmur of embarrassment.&nbsp;
<i>Miss Galbraith</i> looks up at him inquiringly and then
suddenly takes out her porte-monnaie, and fees him.</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;Thank you, miss, thank you.&nbsp; If you
want anything at all, miss, I&rsquo;m right dere at de end of de
cah.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes out by the narrow passage-way beside
the smaller enclosed parlor.&nbsp; <i>Miss Galbraith</i> looks
askance at the sleeping gentleman, and then, rising, goes to the
large mirror, to pin her veil, which has become loosened from her
hat.&nbsp; She gives a little start at sight of the gentleman in
the mirror, but arranges her head-gear, and returning to her
place looks out of the window again.&nbsp; After a little while
she moves about uneasily in her chair, then leans forward, and
tries to raise her window; she lifts it partly up, when the catch
slips from her fingers, and the window falls shut again with a
crash.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, <i>dear</i>, how provoking!&nbsp; I
suppose I must call the porter.&rdquo;&nbsp; She rises from her
seat, but on attempting to move away she finds that the skirt of
her polonaise has been caught in the falling window.&nbsp; She
pulls at it, and then tries to lift the window again, but the
cloth has wedged it in, and she cannot stir it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I certainly think this is beyond endurance!&nbsp;
Porter!&nbsp; Ah,&mdash;Porter!&nbsp; Oh, he&rsquo;ll never hear
me in the racket that these wheels are making!&nbsp; I wish
they&rsquo;d stop,&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;The gentleman stirs in
his chair, lifts his head, listens, takes his feet down from the
other seat, rises abruptly, and comes to <i>Miss
Galbraith&rsquo;s</i> side.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Allen Richards</i>: &ldquo;Will you allow me to open
the window for you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Starting back, &ldquo;Miss
Galbraith!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Al&mdash; Mr.
Richards!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a silence for some moments, in
which they remain looking at each other; then,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I forbid you to address me in
that way, Mr. Richards.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Why, you were just going to call
me Allen!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;That was an accident, you know very
well,&mdash;an impulse&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, so is this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Of which you ought to be ashamed
to take advantage.&nbsp; I wonder at your presumption in speaking
to me at all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite idle, I can assure
you.&nbsp; Everything is at an end between us.&nbsp; It seems
that I bore with you too long; but I&rsquo;m thankful that I had
the spirit to not at last, and to act in time.&nbsp; And now that
chance has thrown us together, I trust that you will not force
your conversation upon me.&nbsp; No gentleman would, and I have
always given you credit for thinking yourself a gentleman.&nbsp;
I request that you will not speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spoken ten words to
me for every one of mine to you.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t annoy
you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe it, Lucy; I can <i>not</i>
believe it.&nbsp; It seems like some rascally dream, and if I had
had any sleep since it happened, I should think
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; You were sleeping
soundly enough when I got into the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I own it; I was perfectly used up,
and I <i>had</i> dropped off.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>, scornfully: &ldquo;Then perhaps you <i>have</i>
dreamed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think so till you tell
me again that our engagement is broken; that the faithful love of
years is to go for nothing; that you dismiss me with cruel
insult, without one word of explanation, without a word of
intelligible accusation, even.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too much!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been thinking it all over and over, and I can&rsquo;t
make head or tail of it.&nbsp; I meant to see you again as soon
as we got to town, and implore you to hear me.&nbsp; Come,
it&rsquo;s a mighty serious matter, Lucy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a
man to put on heroics and that; but <i>I</i> believe it&rsquo;ll
play the very deuce with me, Lucy,&mdash;that is to say, Miss
Galbraith,&mdash;I do indeed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll give me a low
opinion of woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, averting her face: &ldquo;Oh, a very
high opinion of woman you have had!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, with sentiment: &ldquo;Well, there was
one woman whom I thought a perfect angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; May I ask her
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, with a forlorn smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall be obliged to describe her somewhat formally as&mdash;Miss
Galbraith.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Mr. Richards!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve just forbidden
me to say <i>Lucy</i>!&nbsp; You must tell me, dearest, what I
have done to offend you.&nbsp; The worst criminals are not
condemned unheard, and I&rsquo;ve always thought you were
merciful if not just.&nbsp; And now I only ask you to be
just.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, looking out of the window: &ldquo;You
know very well what you&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
expect me to humiliate myself by putting your offence into
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Upon my soul, I don&rsquo;t know
what you mean!&nbsp; I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know what I&rsquo;ve
done.&nbsp; When you came at me, last night, with my ring and
presents and other little traps, you might have knocked me down
with the lightest of the lot.&nbsp; I was perfectly dazed; I
couldn&rsquo;t say anything before you were off, and all I could
do was to hope that you&rsquo;d be more like yourself in the
morning.&nbsp; And in the morning, when I came round to Mrs.
Philips&rsquo;s, I found you were gone, and I came after you by
the next train.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Mr. Richards, your personal
history for the last twenty-four hours is a matter of perfect
indifference to me, as it shall be for the <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>next
twenty-four hundred years.&nbsp; I see that you are resolved to
annoy me, and since you will not leave the car, I must do
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; She rises haughtily from her seat, but the
imprisoned skirt of her polonaise twitches her abruptly back into
her chair.&nbsp; She bursts into tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, what
<i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, dryly: &ldquo;You shall do whatever you
like, Miss Galbraith, when I&rsquo;ve set you free; for I see
your dress is caught in the window.&nbsp; When it&rsquo;s once
out, I&rsquo;ll shut the window, and you can call the porter to
raise it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He leans forward over her chair, and while
she shrinks back the length of her tether, he tugs at the
window-fastening.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get at it.&nbsp;
Would you be so good as to stand up,&mdash;all you
can?&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Galbraith stands up, droopingly, and Mr.
Richards makes a movement towards her, and then falls back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Please sit down
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes round her chair and tries to get at
the window from that side.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get any
purchase on it.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you cut out that
piece?&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Galbraith stares at him in dumb
amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see what we&rsquo;re
to do: I&rsquo;ll go and get the porter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes to
the end of the car, and <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>returns.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
find the porter,&mdash;he must be in one of the other cars.&nbsp;
But&rdquo;&mdash;brightening with the fortunate
conception&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just thought of
something.&nbsp; Will it unbutton?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Unbutton?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Yes; this garment of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;My polonaise?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Inquiringly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s a very
simple matter.&nbsp; If you will just take it off I can
easily&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, faintly: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; A
polonaise isn&rsquo;t like an overcoat&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, with dismay: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Well,
then&rdquo;&mdash;He remains thinking a moment in hopeless
perplexity.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, with polite ceremony: &ldquo;The porter
will be back soon.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself any further
about it, please.&nbsp; I shall do very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, without heeding her: &ldquo;If you could
kneel on that foot-cushion, and face the window&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, kneeling promptly:
&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Yes, and now&rdquo;&mdash;kneeling
beside <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>her&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll allow me to&mdash;to
get at the window-catch,&rdquo;&mdash;he stretches both arms
forward; she shrinks from his right into his left, and then back
again,&mdash;&ldquo;and pull while I raise the
window&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Yes, yes; but do hurry,
please.&nbsp; If any one saw us, I don&rsquo;t know what they
would think.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s perfectly
ridiculous!&rdquo;&mdash;pulling.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s caught
in the corner of the window, between the frame and the sash, and
it won&rsquo;t come!&nbsp; Is my hair troubling you?&nbsp; Is it
in your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my eyes, but it
isn&rsquo;t troubling me.&nbsp; Am I inconveniencing
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, now then, pull
hard!&rdquo;&nbsp; He lifts the window with a great effort; the
polonaise comes free with a start, and she strikes violently
against him.&nbsp; In supporting the shock he cannot forbear
catching her for an instant to his heart.&nbsp; She frees
herself, and starts indignantly to her feet.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, what a
cowardly&mdash;subterfuge!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Cowardly?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no
idea <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>how
much courage it took.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Galbraith puts her
handkerchief to her face, and sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
cry!&nbsp; Bless my heart,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry I did it!&nbsp;
But you know how dearly I love you, Lucy, though I do think
you&rsquo;ve been cruelly unjust.&nbsp; I told you I never should
love any one else, and I never shall.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help
it; upon my soul, I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Nobody could.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let it vex you, my&rdquo;&mdash;He approaches
her.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Please not touch me, sir!&nbsp;
You have no longer any right whatever to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;You misinterpret a very
inoffensive gesture.&nbsp; I have no idea of touching you, but I
hope I may be allowed, as a special favor, to&mdash;pick up my
hat, which you are in the act of stepping on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Galbraith hastily turns, and strikes the hat with her whirling
skirts; it rolls to the other side of the parlor, and Mr.
Richards, who goes after it, utters an ironical
&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;&nbsp; He brushes it, and puts it on,
looking at her where she has again seated herself at the window
with her back to him, and continues, &ldquo;As for any further
molestation from me&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;If you <i>will</i> talk to
me&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span><i>Mr.
Richards</i>: &ldquo;Excuse me, I am not talking to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I was beginning to think
aloud.&nbsp; I&mdash;I was soliloquizing.&nbsp; I suppose I may
be allowed to soliloquize?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, very coldly: &ldquo;You can do what you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Unfortunately that&rsquo;s just
what I can&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; If I could do as I liked, I should
ask you a single question.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, after a moment: &ldquo;Well, sir, you
may ask your question.&rdquo;&nbsp; She remains as before, with
her chin in her hand, looking tearfully out of the window; her
face is turned from Mr. Richards, who hesitates a moment before
he speaks.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I wish to ask you just this, Miss
Galbraith: if you couldn&rsquo;t ride backwards in the other car,
why do you ride backwards in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, burying her face in her handkerchief,
and sobbing: &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&nbsp; This is too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Oh, come now, Lucy.&nbsp; It
breaks my heart to hear you going on so, and all for <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>nothing.&nbsp; Be a little merciful to both of us, and
listen to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt I can explain everything
if I once understand it, but it&rsquo;s pretty hard explaining a
thing if you don&rsquo;t understand it yourself.&nbsp; Do turn
round.&nbsp; I know it makes you sick to ride in that way, and if
you don&rsquo;t want to face
me&mdash;there!&rdquo;&mdash;wheeling in his chair so as to turn
his back upon her&mdash;&ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Though
it&rsquo;s rather trying to a fellow&rsquo;s politeness, not to
mention his other feelings.&nbsp; Now, what in the
name&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>, who at this moment enters with his step-ladder,
and begins to light the lamps: &ldquo;Going pretty slow
ag&rsquo;in, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Yes; what&rsquo;s the
trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly,
sah.&nbsp; Something de matter with de locomotive.&nbsp; We
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be into Albany much &lsquo;fore eight
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the next
station?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;Schenectady.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Is the whole train as empty as
this car?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>, laughing: &ldquo;Well, no, sah.&nbsp; Fact is,
dis cah don&rsquo;t belong on dis train.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
Pullman that we hitched on when you got in, and we&rsquo;s taking
it <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>along
for one of de Eastern roads.&nbsp; We let you in &lsquo;cause de
Drawing-rooms was all full.&nbsp; Same with de
lady,&rdquo;&mdash;looking sympathetically at her, as he takes
his steps to go out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I do anything for you now,
miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, plaintively: &ldquo;No, thank you;
nothing whatever.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has turned while <i>Mr.
Richards</i> and <i>The Porter</i> have been speaking, and now
faces the back of the former, but her veil is drawn
closely.&nbsp; <i>The Porter</i> goes out.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, wheeling round so as to confront her:
&ldquo;I wish you would speak to me half as kindly as you do to
that darky, Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;<i>He</i> is a
<i>gentleman</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;He is an urbane and well-informed
nobleman.&nbsp; At any rate, he&rsquo;s a man and a
brother.&nbsp; But so am I.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Galbraith</i>
does not reply, and after a pause <i>Mr. Richards</i>
resumes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talking of gentlemen, I recollect, once,
coming up on the day-boat to Poughkeepsie, there was a poor devil
of a tipsy man kept following a young fellow about, and annoying
him to death&mdash;trying to fight him, as a tipsy man will, and
insisting that the young fellow had insulted him.&nbsp; By and by
he lost his balance and went overboard, and the other <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>jumped after
him and fished him out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sensation on the part of
<i>Miss Galbraith</i>, who stirs uneasily in her chair, looks out
of the window, then looks at <i>Mr. Richards</i>, and drops her
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was a young lady on board, who had seen
the whole thing&mdash;a very charming young lady indeed, with
pale blond hair growing very thick over her forehead, and dark
eyelashes to the sweetest blue eyes in the world.&nbsp; Well,
this young lady&rsquo;s papa was amongst those who came up to say
civil things to the young fellow when he got aboard again, and to
ask the honor&mdash;he said the <i>honor</i>&mdash;of his
acquaintance.&nbsp; And when he came out of his stateroom in dry
clothes, this infatuated old gentleman was waiting for him, and
took him and introduced him to his wife and daughter; and the
daughter said, with tears in her eyes, and a perfectly
intoxicating impulsiveness, that it was the grandest and the most
heroic and the noblest thing that she had ever seen, and she
should always be a better girl for having seen it.&nbsp; Excuse
me, Miss Galbraith, for troubling you with these facts of a
personal history, which, as you say, is a matter of perfect
indifference to you.&nbsp; The young fellow didn&rsquo;t think at
the time he had done anything extraordinary; <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>but I
don&rsquo;t suppose he <i>did</i> expect to live to have the same
girl tell him he was no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, wildly: &ldquo;O Allen, Allen!&nbsp;
You <i>know</i> I think you are a gentleman, and I always
did!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, languidly: &ldquo;Oh, I merely had your
word for it, just now, that you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tenderly, &ldquo;Will you hear me, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, faintly: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, what is it I&rsquo;ve
done?&nbsp; Will you tell me if I guess right?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, with dignity: &ldquo;I am in no humor
for jesting, Allen.&nbsp; And I can assure you that though I
consent to hear what you have to say, or ask, <i>nothing</i> will
change my determination.&nbsp; All is over between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Yes, I understand that,
perfectly.&nbsp; I am now asking merely for general
information.&nbsp; I do not expect you to relent, and, in fact, I
should consider it rather frivolous if you did.&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
What I have always admired in your character, Lucy, is a firm,
logical consistency; a clearness of mental vision that leaves no
side of a subject unsearched; and an unwavering constancy <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>of
purpose.&nbsp; You may say that these traits are characteristic
of <i>all</i> women; but they are pre-eminently characteristic of
you, Lucy.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss Galbraith</i> looks askance at
him, to make out whether he is in earnest or not; he continues,
with a perfectly serious air.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I know now that if
you&rsquo;re offended with me, it&rsquo;s for no trivial
cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; She stirs uncomfortably in her
chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What I have done I can&rsquo;t imagine,
but it must be something monstrous, since it has made life with
me appear so impossible that you are ready to fling away your own
happiness&mdash;for I know you <i>did</i> love me, Lucy&mdash;and
destroy mine.&nbsp; I will begin with the worst thing I can think
of.&nbsp; Was it because I danced so much with Fanny
Watervliet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, indignantly: &ldquo;How can you insult
me by supposing that I could be jealous of such a perfect little
goose as that?&nbsp; No, Allen!&nbsp; Whatever I think of you, I
still respect you too much for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that there
are yet depths to which you think me incapable of descending, and
that Miss Watervliet is one of them.&nbsp; I will now take a
little higher ground.&nbsp; Perhaps you think I flirted with Mrs.
Dawes.&nbsp; I <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>thought, myself, that the thing might begin to have that
appearance, but I give you my word of honor that as soon as the
idea occurred to me, I dropped her&mdash;rather rudely,
too.&nbsp; The trouble was, don&rsquo;t you know, that I felt so
perfectly safe with a <i>married</i> friend of yours.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t be hanging about you all the time, and I was
afraid I might vex you if I went with the other girls; and I
didn&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I think you behaved rather
silly, giggling so much with her.&nbsp; But&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I own it, I know it was
silly.&nbsp; But&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that; it
wasn&rsquo;t that!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Was it my forgetting to bring you
those things from your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Was it because I hadn&rsquo;t
given up smoking yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;You <i>know</i> I never asked
you to give up smoking.&nbsp; It was entirely your own
proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what made me so easy about it.&nbsp; I knew I could
leave it off <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span><i>any</i> time.&nbsp; Well, I will not disturb you any
longer, Miss Galbraith.&rdquo;&nbsp; He throws his overcoat
across his arm, and takes up his travelling-bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have failed to guess your fatal&mdash;conundrum; and I have no
longer any excuse for remaining.&nbsp; I am going into the
smoking-car.&nbsp; Shall I send the porter to you for
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
puts up her handkerchief to her face.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Lucy, do you send me
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, behind her handkerchief: &ldquo;You
were going, yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, over his shoulder: &ldquo;Shall I come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I have no right to drive you
from the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, coming back, and sitting down in the
chair nearest her: &ldquo;Lucy, dearest, tell me what&rsquo;s the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;O Allen! your not <i>knowing</i>
makes it all the more hopeless and killing.&nbsp; It shows me
that we <i>must</i> part; that you would go on, breaking my
heart, and grinding me into the dust as long as we
lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;It shows me that you
never understood me, and you never <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>will.&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;re good
and kind and all that, but that only makes your not understanding
me so much the worse.&nbsp; I do it quite as much for your sake
as my own, Allen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather you
wouldn&rsquo;t put yourself out on my account.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, without regarding him: &ldquo;If you
could mortify me before a whole roomful of people, as you did
last night, what could I expect after marriage but continual
insult?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, in amazement: &ldquo;<i>How</i> did I
mortify you?&nbsp; I thought that I treated you with all the
tenderness and affection that a decent regard for the feelings of
others would allow.&nbsp; I was ashamed to find I couldn&rsquo;t
keep away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, you were <i>attentive</i>
enough, Allen; nobody denies that.&nbsp; Attentive enough in
non-essentials.&nbsp; Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, what vital matters did I
fail in?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I dare say!&nbsp; I dare say
they won&rsquo;t appear vital to you, Allen.&nbsp; Nothing
does.&nbsp; And if I had told you, I should have been met with
ridicule, I suppose.&nbsp; But I knew <i>better</i> than to tell;
I respected myself too <i>much</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span><i>Mr.
Richards</i>: &ldquo;But now you mustn&rsquo;t respect yourself
<i>quite</i> so much, dearest.&nbsp; And I promise you I
won&rsquo;t laugh at the most serious thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in
no humor for it.&nbsp; If it were a matter of life and death,
even, I can assure you that it wouldn&rsquo;t bring a smile to my
countenance.&nbsp; No, indeed!&nbsp; If you expect me to laugh,
now, you must say something particularly funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I was not going to say anything
funny, as you call it, and I will say nothing at all, if you talk
in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t, then.&nbsp;
But do you know what I suspect, Lucy?&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
mention it to everybody, but I will to you&mdash;in strict
confidence: I suspect that you&rsquo;re rather ashamed of your
grievance, if you have any.&nbsp; I suspect it&rsquo;s nothing at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, very sternly at first, with a rising
hysterical inflection: &ldquo;Nothing, Allen!&nbsp; Do you call
it <i>nothing</i>, to have Mrs. Dawes come out with all that
about your accident on your way up the river, and ask me if it
didn&rsquo;t frighten me terribly to hear of it, even after it
was all over; and I had to say you hadn&rsquo;t told me a word of
it?&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Lucy!&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;angrily mimicking
Mrs. Dawes,&mdash;<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;you must teach him better than that.&nbsp;
I make Mr. Dawes tell me everything.&rsquo;&nbsp; Little
simpleton!&nbsp; And then to have them all laugh&mdash;Oh, dear,
it&rsquo;s too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Why, my dear
Lucy&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, interrupting him: &ldquo;I saw just how
it was going to be, and I&rsquo;m thankful, <i>thankful</i> that
it happened.&nbsp; I saw that you didn&rsquo;t care enough for me
to take me into your whole life; that you despised and distrusted
me, and that it would get worse and worse to the end of our days;
that we should grow farther and farther apart, and I should be
left moping at home, while you ran about making confidantes of
other women whom you considered <i>worthy</i> of your
confidence.&nbsp; It all <i>flashed</i> upon me in an
<i>instant</i>; and I resolved to break with you, then and there;
and I did, just as soon as ever I could go to my room for your
things, and I&rsquo;m glad,&mdash;yes,&mdash;Oh, hu, hu, hu, hu,
hu!&mdash;<i>so</i> glad I did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, grimly: &ldquo;Your joy is obvious.&nbsp;
May I ask&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t the
<i>first</i> proof you had given me how little you really cared
for me, but I was determined it should be the last.&nbsp; I <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>dare say
you&rsquo;ve forgotten them!&nbsp; I dare say you don&rsquo;t
remember telling Mamie Morris that you didn&rsquo;t like
embroidered cigar-cases, when you&rsquo;d just <i>told</i> me
that you did, and let me be such a fool as to commence one for
you; but I&rsquo;m thankful to say <i>that</i> went into the
fire,&mdash;oh, yes, <i>instantly</i>!&nbsp; And I dare say
you&rsquo;ve forgotten that you didn&rsquo;t tell me your
brother&rsquo;s engagement was to be kept, and let me come out
with it that night at the Rudges&rsquo;, and then looked
perfectly aghast, so that everybody thought I had been
blabbing!&nbsp; Time and again, Allen, you have made me suffer
agonies, yes, <i>agonies</i>; but your power to do so is at an
end.&nbsp; I am free and happy at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; She weeps
bitterly.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, quietly: &ldquo;Yes, I <i>had</i>
forgotten those crimes, and I suppose many similar
atrocities.&nbsp; I own it, I <i>am</i> forgetful and
careless.&nbsp; I was wrong about those things.&nbsp; I ought to
have told you why I said that to Miss Morris: I was afraid she
was going to work me one.&nbsp; As to that accident I told Mrs.
Dawes of, it wasn&rsquo;t worth mentioning.&nbsp; Our boat simply
walked over a sloop in the night, and nobody was hurt.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t have thought twice about it, if she hadn&rsquo;t
happened to brag of their <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>passing close to an iceberg on their
way home from Europe; then I trotted out <i>my</i> pretty-near
disaster as a match for hers,&mdash;confound her!&nbsp; I wish
the iceberg had sunk them!&nbsp; Only it wouldn&rsquo;t have sunk
her,&mdash;she&rsquo;s so light; she&rsquo;d have gone bobbing
about all over the Atlantic Ocean, like a cork; she&rsquo;s got a
perfect life-preserver in that mind of hers.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Miss
Galbraith</i> gives a little laugh, and then a little moan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But since you are happy, I will not repine, Miss
Galbraith.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t pretend to be very happy myself,
but then, I don&rsquo;t deserve it.&nbsp; Since you are ready to
let an absolutely unconscious offence on my part cancel all the
past; since you let my devoted love weigh as nothing against the
momentary pique that a malicious little rattle-pate&mdash;she was
vexed at my leaving her&mdash;could make you feel, and choose to
gratify a wicked resentment at the cost of any suffering to me,
why, I can be glad and happy too.&rdquo;&nbsp; With rising anger,
&ldquo;Yes, Miss Galbraith.&nbsp; All <i>is</i> over between
us.&nbsp; You can go!&nbsp; I renounce you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, springing fiercely to her feet:
&ldquo;Go, indeed!&nbsp; Renounce me!&nbsp; Be so good as to
remember that you haven&rsquo;t got me <i>to</i>
renounce!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same
thing.&nbsp; <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>I&rsquo;d renounce you if I had.&nbsp; Good-evening,
Miss Galbraith.&nbsp; I will send back your presents as soon as I
get to town; it won&rsquo;t be necessary to acknowledge
them.&nbsp; I hope we may never meet again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes
out of the door towards the front of the ear, but returns
directly, and glances uneasily at Miss Galbraith, who remains
with her handkerchief pressed to her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;a&mdash;that is&mdash;I shall be obliged to
intrude upon you again.&nbsp; The fact is&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, anxiously: &ldquo;Why, the cars have
stopped!&nbsp; Are we at Schenectady?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, no; not <i>exactly</i>; not
stopped exactly at <i>Schenectady</i>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Then what station is this?&nbsp;
Have they carried me by?&rdquo;&nbsp; Observing his
embarrassment, &ldquo;Allen, what is the matter?&nbsp; What has
happened?&nbsp; Tell me instantly!&nbsp; Are we off the
track?&nbsp; Have we run into another train?&nbsp; Have we broken
through a bridge?&nbsp; Shall we be burnt alive?&nbsp; Tell me,
Allen, tell me,&mdash;I can bear it!&mdash;are we
telescoped?&rdquo;&nbsp; She wrings her hands in terror.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, unsympathetically: &ldquo;Nothing of the
kind has happened.&nbsp; This car has simply come <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>uncoupled,
and the rest of the train has gone on ahead, and left us standing
on the track, nowhere in particular.&rdquo;&nbsp; He leans back
in his chair, and wheels it round from her.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, mortified, yet anxious:
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well, until they miss us, and run
back to pick us up, I shall be obliged to ask your
indulgence.&nbsp; I will try not to disturb you; I would go out
and stand on the platform, but it&rsquo;s raining.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, listening to the rain-fall on the roof:
&ldquo;Why, so it is!&rdquo;&nbsp; Timidly, &ldquo;Did you notice
when the car stopped?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rises and goes
out at the rear door, comes back, and sits down again.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, rises, and goes to the large mirror to
wipe away her tears.&nbsp; She glances at Mr. Richards, who does
not move.&nbsp; She sits down in a seat nearer him than the chair
she has left.&nbsp; After some faint murmurs and hesitations, she
asks, &ldquo;Will you please tell me why you went out just
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, with indifference: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I
went to see if the rear signal was out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>, after another hesitation: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Because, if it wasn&rsquo;t out,
some train might run into us from that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, tremulously: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; And was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, dryly: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i> returns to her former place, with a
wounded air, and for a moment neither speaks.&nbsp; Finally she
asks very meekly, &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no danger from the
front?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, coldly: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, after some little noises and movements
meant to catch Mr. Richards&rsquo;s attention: &ldquo;Of course,
I never meant to imply that you were intentionally careless or
forgetful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, still very coldly: &ldquo;Thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I always did justice to your
good-heartedness, Allen; you&rsquo;re perfectly lovely that way;
and I know that you would be sorry if you knew you had wounded my
feelings, however accidentally.&rdquo;&nbsp; She droops her head
so as to catch a sidelong glimpse of his face, and sighs, while
she nervously pinches the top of her parasol, resting the point
on the floor.&nbsp; Mr. Richards makes no answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That about the cigar-case <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>might have been a mistake; I saw that
myself, and, as you explain it, why, it was certainly very kind
and very creditable to&mdash;to your thoughtfulness.&nbsp; It
<i>was</i> thoughtful!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I am grateful for your good
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;But do you think it was
exactly&mdash;it was quite&mdash;nice, not to tell me that your
brother&rsquo;s engagement was to be kept, when you know, Allen,
I can&rsquo;t bear to blunder in such things?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tenderly, &ldquo;<i>Do</i> you?&nbsp; You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> say
it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I never said it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, plaintively: &ldquo;No, Allen.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I always admired in your character.&nbsp; You
always owned up.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s easier
for men to own up than it is for women?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I never
knew any woman to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes, Allen!&nbsp; You know I
<i>often</i> own up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh, how can you bear to say
so?&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m rash, or anything of that kind, you know
I acknowledge it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span><i>Mr.
Richards</i>: &ldquo;Do you acknowledge it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Why, how can I, when I
haven&rsquo;t <i>been</i> rash?&nbsp; <i>What</i> have I been
rash&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;About the cigar-case, for
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Oh! <i>that</i>!&nbsp; That was
a great while ago!&nbsp; I thought you meant something quite
recent.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sound as of the approaching tram is heard
in the distance.&nbsp; She gives a start, and then leaves her
chair again for one a little nearer his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought
perhaps you meant about&mdash;last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, very judicially: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think it was <i>rash</i>, exactly.&nbsp; No, not
<i>rash</i>.&nbsp; It might not have been very <i>kind</i> not
to&mdash;to&mdash;trust you more, when I knew that you
didn&rsquo;t mean anything; but&mdash;No, I took the only course
I could.&nbsp; Nobody could have done differently under the
circumstances.&nbsp; But if I caused you any pain, I&rsquo;m very
sorry; oh, yes, very sorry indeed.&nbsp; But I was not
precipitate, and I know I did right.&nbsp; At least I
<i>tried</i> to act for the best.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe I
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span><i>Mr.
Richards</i>: &ldquo;Why, if you have no doubt upon the subject,
my opinion is of no consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But what do you
think?&nbsp; If you think differently, and can make me see it
differently, oughtn&rsquo;t you to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why.&nbsp; As
you say, all is over between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a pause,
&ldquo;I should suppose you would care enough for yourself to
wish me to look at the matter from the right point of
view.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, becoming more and more uneasy as the
noise of the approaching train grows louder: &ldquo;I think you
have been very quick with me at times, quite as quick as I could
have been with you last night.&rdquo;&nbsp; The noise is more
distinctly heard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that if I could
once see it as you do, no one would be more willing to do
anything in their power to atone for their rashness.&nbsp; Of
course I know that everything is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;As to that, I have your word; and,
in view of the fact, perhaps this analysis of <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>motive, of
character, however interesting on general grounds, is a
little&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, with sudden violence: &ldquo;Say it,
and take your revenge!&nbsp; I have put myself at your feet, and
you do right to trample on me!&nbsp; Oh, this is what women may
expect when they trust to men&rsquo;s generosity!&nbsp; Well, it
<i>is</i> over now, and I&rsquo;m thankful, thankful!&nbsp;
Cruel, suspicious, vindictive, you&rsquo;re all alike, and
I&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;m no longer subject to your heartless
caprices.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t care what happens after this, I
shall always&mdash;Oh!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s from
the front, Allen?&nbsp; Are you sure the rear signal is
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, relenting: &ldquo;Yes, but if it will
ease your mind, I&rsquo;ll go and look again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
rises, and starts towards the rear door.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, quickly: &ldquo;Oh, no!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t go!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear to be left
alone!&rdquo;&nbsp; The sound of the approaching train
continually increases in volume.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it
coming very, very, <i>very</i> fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, running towards the rear door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I <i>must</i> get out!&nbsp; It will kill me, I know
it will.&nbsp; Come with me!&nbsp; Do, do!&rdquo;&nbsp; He runs
after her, and her voice is heard at the rear of the car.&nbsp;
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>&ldquo;Oh,
the outside door is locked, and we are trapped, trapped,
trapped!&nbsp; Oh, quick!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s try the door at the
other end.&rdquo;&nbsp; They re-enter the parlor, and the roar of
the train announces that it is upon them.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
no!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too late, it&rsquo;s too late!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a wicked, wicked girl, and this is all to punish
me!&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s coming at full
speed!&rdquo;&nbsp; He remains bewildered, confronting her.&nbsp;
She utters a wild cry, and as the train strikes the car with a
violent concussion, she flings herself into his arms.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; Forgive me, Allen!&nbsp; Let us die
together, my own, own love!&rdquo;&nbsp; She hangs fainting on
his breast.&nbsp; Voices are heard without, and after a little
delay <i>The Porter</i> comes in with a lantern.</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;Rather more of a jah than we meant to
give you, sah!&nbsp; We had to run down pretty quick after we
missed you, and the rain made the track a little slippery.&nbsp;
Lady much frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, disengaging herself: &ldquo;Oh, not at
all!&nbsp; Not in the least.&nbsp; We thought it was a train
coming from behind, and going to run into us, and
so&mdash;we&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>: &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll be into Schenectady in a few minutes, miss.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>come for your things.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes out at the
other door.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, in a fearful whisper:
&ldquo;Allen!&nbsp; What will he ever think of us?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure he saw us!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
he&rsquo;ll think <i>now</i>.&nbsp; He <i>did</i> think you were
frightened; but you told him you were not.&nbsp; However, it
isn&rsquo;t important what he thinks.&nbsp; Probably he thinks
I&rsquo;m your long-lost brother.&nbsp; It had a kind of family
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;d never suppose that
I was a jilted lover of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, ruefully: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Come, Lucy,&rdquo;&mdash;taking
her hand,&mdash;&ldquo;you wished to die with me, a moment
ago.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think you can make one more effort to
live with me?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t take advantage of words spoken
in mortal peril, but I suppose you were in earnest when you
called me your own&mdash;own&rdquo;&mdash;Her head droops; he
folds her in his arms a moment, then she starts away from him, as
if something had suddenly occurred to her.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Allen, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Going?&nbsp; Upon my soul, I

<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Where <i>were</i> you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I <i>was</i> going to
Albany.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Aunt
Mary is expecting me here at Schenectady,&mdash;I telegraphed
her,&mdash;and I want you to stop here, too, and we&rsquo;ll
refer the whole matter to her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s such a wise old
head.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, demurely: &ldquo;That I&rsquo;m good
enough for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, starting, in burlesque of her movement,
as if a thought had struck <i>him</i>: &ldquo;Lucy! how came you
on this train when you left Syracuse on the morning
express?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, faintly: &ldquo;I waited over a train
at Utica.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sinks into a chair, and averts her
face.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, more faintly still: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to tell.&nbsp; I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, coming and standing in front of her, with
his hands in his pockets: &ldquo;Look me <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>in the eye,
Lucy!&rdquo;&nbsp; She drops her veil over her face, and looks up
at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you expect to find
<i>me</i> on this train?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;I was afraid it never
<i>would</i> get along,&mdash;it was so late!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;tergiversate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
<i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Fib.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Not for worlds!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;How did you know I was in this
car?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Must I?&nbsp; I thought I saw
you through the window; and then I made sure it was you when I
went to pin my veil on,&mdash;I saw you in the mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, after a little silence: &ldquo;Miss
Galbraith, do you want to know what <i>you</i> are?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, softly: &ldquo;Yes, Allen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a humbug!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, springing from her seat, and
confronting him.&nbsp; &ldquo;So are you!&nbsp; You pretended to
be asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I was taken by
surprise.&nbsp; I had to take time to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span><i>Mr.
Richards</i>: &ldquo;And you thought it would be a good plan to
get your polonaise caught in the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, hiding her face on his shoulder:
&ldquo;No, no, Allen!&nbsp; That I never <i>will</i> admit.&nbsp;
<i>No</i> woman would!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I dare say!&rdquo;&nbsp; After
a pause: &ldquo;Well, I am a poor, weak, helpless man, with no
one to advise me or counsel me, and I have been cruelly
deceived.&nbsp; How could you, Lucy, how could you?&nbsp; I can
never get over this.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drops his head upon her
shoulder.</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, starting away again, and looking about
the car: &ldquo;Allen, I have an idea!&nbsp; Do you suppose Mr.
Pullman could be induced to <i>sell</i> this car?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Why, because I think it&rsquo;s
perfectly lovely, and I should like to live in it always.&nbsp;
It could be fitted up for a sort of summer-house, don&rsquo;t you
know, and we could have it in the garden, and you could smoke in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Admirable!&nbsp; It would look
just like a travelling photographic saloon.&nbsp; No, Lucy, we
won&rsquo;t buy it; we will simply keep it <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>as a precious
souvenir, a sacred memory, a beautiful dream,&mdash;and let it go
on fulfilling its destiny all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Porter</i>, entering, and gathering up <i>Miss
Galbraith&rsquo;s</i> things: &ldquo;Be at Schenectady in half a
minute, miss.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t have much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>, rising, and adjusting her dress, and
then looking about the car, while she passes her hand through her
lover&rsquo;s arm: &ldquo;Oh, I do <i>hate</i> to leave it.&nbsp;
Farewell, you dear, kind, good, lovely car!&nbsp; May you never
have another accident!&rdquo;&nbsp; She kisses her hand to the
car, upon which they both look back as they slowly leave it.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>, kissing his hand in the like manner:
&ldquo;Good-by, sweet chariot!&nbsp; May you never carry any but
bridal couples!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Or engaged ones!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Or husbands going home to their
wives!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Or wives hastening to their
husbands.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Richards</i>: &ldquo;Or young ladies who have waited
one train over, so as to be with the young men they
hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span><i>Miss
Galbraith</i>: &ldquo;Or young men who are so indifferent that
they pretend to be asleep when the young ladies come
in!&rdquo;&nbsp; They pause at the door and look back
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;And must I leave thee,
Paradise?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; They both kiss their hands to the
car again, and, their faces being very close together, they
impulsively kiss each other.&nbsp; Then <i>Miss Galbraith</i>
throws back her head, and solemnly confronts him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only think, Allen!&nbsp; If this car hadn&rsquo;t broken
<i>its</i> engagement, we might never have mended
ours.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
